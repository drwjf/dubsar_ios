Dubsar for iOS
==============

Dubsar for iOS is an open-source universal application for iPhone,
iPod Touch and iPad that allow users to search and browse the WordNet(R) content
in a local database. Dubsar 1.3.2 is available for free worldwide
in the App Store for iOS 5.0 and higher.

Dubsar 2.0
==========

The version of Dubsar in the master branch has been mostly rewritten in Swift. The
Objective-C model code has been split into a separate framework. This version will
be released to the App Store once the iOS 8 SDK is released to production. It will
require iOS 7.0 or later. The old version (1.3.x) will still be available in the
App Store for iOS 5 and 6. Stay tuned for more details.
